Each zones dict bind__(global|group|host)_zones parameters are merged before being applied by ansible, so it let you to define zones in multiple place of Ansible inventory.


### Zone statements

Each zone statement represent the zone declaration with settings and the zone "body" with DNS entries (if needed)

* In case of a static zone (aka master), you can use the following settings

```
bind__global_zones:
  'zone name':
    type: 'master' to declare a static zone or 'slave' to set a zone
    file: 'auto' to let ansible manage the path to the zone file or specify manually a path
    entries:
      - zone entry statement (see below)
      - zone entry statement
```

* In case of a slave zone, you can use the following settings

```
bind__global_zones:
  'zone name':
    type: 'master' to declare a static zone or 'slave' to set a zone
    file: 'auto' to let ansible manage the path to the zone file or specify manually a path
    masters: String or list of masters servers
    allow_update: Optionnal String or list of servers allowed to perform an update
```

### Zone entry statements

For static zone, you have to define zone entries using the following specifications.
The 'entries' key must be a list of dict.
Each dict (corresponding to an DNS Resource Record) can contains theses keys.


* name: the name of the record, default to empty (to allow declaration of multiple records with same name)
* ttl: default to empty (see bind default ttl value)
* class: default to IN
* type: the type of entry in classical availables types : A, CNAME....
According the the 'type' key, the 'data' key must follow some restrictions (see below)
* data: the content of the entry, take care, if the 'type' value is implemented in this role the data field must be correctly formatted (see paragraph below). Otherwise, the data field will be printed as is in the zone file.
* comment: optionnal comment at the end of the line

Somes examples :

* a simple entry with defaults specifications omitted

```
- name: server1
  type: A
  data: 192.168.1.1
```

* a SOA record with all required values

```
- name: '@'
  type: SOA
  data:
    ns: 'server1'
    email: 'admin@example.com'
    serial:   "00000000"
    refresh:  604800
    retry:    86400
    expiry:   2419200
    negative: 604800
```


### Zone entry type implementations

Some RR types are implemented directly by this role, so you have to format the 'data' field with a correct dict instead of simply set it to a string

This is the list of specifically implemented types :

* [SOA](#soa-type)
* [SSHFP](#sshfp-type)

#### SOA type

Each DNS zone must have a SOA entry, so this role takes in considerations the two following cases:

* You provided yourself a SOA entry in the 'entries' key of the current zone: your SOA entry will be used, so it must contains all required field !!
* You did not provide a SOA entry for the current zone: Ansible will create one for you, please be sure that you have at least one NS entry, it will be used as SOA NS value. And the serial value will be automatically incremented at each zone changes

If you choose to provide by yourself the SOA record please set all the following keys:

```
- name: '@' # the name of your zone
  type: SOA # mandatory
  data:
    ns: 'server1'               # the fqdn of your main name server
    email: 'admin@example.com'  # the administrator email, any arobase sign will be converted to dot
    serial: "00000000"          # The serial (please ensure that it is correctly updated at each zone changes)
    refresh: 604800             # refresh time for slave servers
    retry: 86400                # time between slave retry attempts
    expiry: 2419200             # expiry time considered by slave for this zone
    negative: 604800            # minimum time/default ttl (see implementations according to your version of bind)
```

#### SSHFP type

```
- name: 'host' # the name of your host
  type: SSHFP # mandatory
  data:
    algorithm: 2   # algorithm integer
    type:      1   # key type integer
    fingerprint: 0C130CDFAF53DB6146232855D9A072  # raw fingerprint
```

For conveniance a filter that generate needed value is included with this role

```
- name: 'host'
  type: SSHFP
  data: "{{ ansible_ssh_host_key_rsa_public|sshfp_record_data_from_key('ssh-rsa', 'SHA-1') }}"
```

I recommend you to use a loop to generate theses entries

```
{% for fact_name, key_type in bind__sshfp_facts_key_type_mapping|dictsort if vars[sshfp_fact_name] is defined -%}
{%   set _ = zone.entries.append({
       'name': inventory_hostname,
       'type': 'SSHFP',
       'data': vars[fact_name]|sshfp_record_data_from_key(key_type, 'SHA-1') }) -%}
{%   set _ = zone.entries.append({
       'name': hostname|replace('.'~zone_name, ''),
       'type': 'SSHFP',
       'data': vars[fact_name]|sshfp_record_data_from_key(key_type, 'SHA-256') }) -%}
{% endfor -%}
```

### Features

* Root server list update

Ansible try to manage list of root servers by it self. To prevent a malicious file to be downloaded it check the checksums of this file against the value of bind__root_server_source_checksum setting.
If it does not match, ansible will fail with an error. To bypass the error set the bind__root_server_source_ignore to true, then the error will be discarded and the file will NOT be downloaded as far.

I personnaly use this role, and then perform, an update of this checksum each time the source file change, so you can keep an eye on my repository. Otherwise you can manage it by yourself.

## Facts

By default the local fact are installed and expose the following variables :


* ```ansible_local.bind.version_full```
* ```ansible_local.bind.version_major```

## Example

### Playbook

Use it in a playbook as follows:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:

To use this role create or update your playbook according the following example :

```
bind__allow_query:
  - '192.168.1.0/24'
  - 'localhost'

  - 127.0.0.1
bind__allow_recursion: '192.168.1.0/24'
bind__empty_contact: 'admin@example.com'
bind__global_zones:
  'test.example.local':
    type: 'master'
    file: 'auto'
    entries:
      - { name: '@',                 type: 'NS',     data: 'dns1.example.com.' }
      - { name: 'dns1.example.com.', type: 'A',      data: '192.168.1.10'      }
      - { name: 'srv1',              type: 'A',      data: '192.168.1.210'    }
